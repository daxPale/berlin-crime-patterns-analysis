# Crime Patterns in Berlin: A Comprehensive Spatial and Temporal Analysis

## Abstract

This research presents a rigorous analysis of crime patterns in Berlin, Germany, employing advanced spatial and temporal data analysis techniques. The study systematically examines crime distribution across different administrative districts, temporal patterns, and their correlations with urban characteristics. Through quantitative analysis of various crime types including robbery, assault, theft, drug offenses, and property damage across Berlin's districts from 2012 onwards, this research provides evidence-based insights into urban crime dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

Berlin, as Germany's capital and largest city, presents a compelling case study for urban crime analysis. This research aims to provide empirical insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of criminal activities across the city's districts. The study focuses on understanding crime patterns, identifying high-risk areas, and analyzing temporal trends in different types of criminal activities, contributing to the broader field of urban criminology and public safety research.

### 1.1 Research Objectives

- Analyze spatial distribution patterns of different crime types across Berlin's districts
- Investigate temporal trends and seasonal variations in criminal activities
- Examine correlations between urban characteristics and crime patterns
- Develop evidence-based insights for urban safety planning

## 2. Data and Methodology

### 2.1 Data Sources

- Berlin crime statistics (berlin_crimes.csv): Comprehensive crime data across districts from 2012 onwards
- Berlin district boundaries (berlin_lor.geojson): Geographic data for spatial analysis
- Additional urban characteristic data for correlation analysis

### 2.2 Methodology

The analysis employs a multi-method approach:

- Spatial analysis using GeoJSON data for district-level mapping
- Temporal pattern analysis using time series decomposition
- Statistical methods for crime distribution and clustering analysis
- Advanced data visualization techniques including heat maps and time series analysis
- Comparative analysis between districts and crime types
- Correlation analysis between urban characteristics and crime patterns
